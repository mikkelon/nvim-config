## Mikkel Overgaard's Neovim Configuration

Welcome to my personal Neovim configuration! This repository serves as both a backup for myself and a resource to share with others. The configuration is based on [nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), providing a clean and minimalistic setup.

### Features

- **Customization**: Built upon kickstart.nvim, my configuration includes additional plugins and tailored settings to enhance the editing experience.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Incorporates plugins such as nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim for file tree navigation, karb94/neoscroll.nvim for smooth scrolling and ggandor/leap.nvim for enhanced navigation.
- **Custom Keymaps**: I have added custom keymaps to improve productivity, which are organized in a separate file called "keymaps.lua".
